# Configuring pubsub Connector

## Initializing the connector

To use the pubsub connector, add the <pubsub.init> element to your configuration before carrying out
any connector operations. The <pubsub.init> element supports authentication via headers, and you can enable
TLS support by selecting the corresponding checkbox in the init form.
